- 👋 Hi, I’m @BenjiCoder02

- 👀 I’m currently interested in Full Stack development using the MERN Stack. I really love React so much. 

- 🌱 I’m currently working on improving my full stack skills by building more complex projects every week. 

- 🌱 My interests for the near to distant future are to explore TypeScript, Docker and Kubernetes (I've heard so much about them. really want to see what the 
-    hype is about) and I'm also interested in Machine Learning and Data science. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on amazing projects. 

- 📫 How to reach me ... You can check out my portfolio site on Github pages for my contact info. No spammers please. ;)
